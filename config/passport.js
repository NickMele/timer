// Passport session setup.
//   To support persistent login sessions, Passport needs to be able to
//   serialize users into and deserialize users out of the session.  Typically,
//   this will be as simple as storing the user ID when serializing, and finding
//   the user by ID when deserializing.  However, since this example does not
//   have a database of user records, the complete Google profile is serialized
//   and deserialized.
passport.serializeUser(function(user, done) {

// Use the GoogleStrategy within Passport.
//   Strategies in passport require a `validate` function, which accept
//   credentials (in this case, an OpenID identifier and profile), and invoke a
//   callback with a user object.
passport.use(new GoogleStrategy({
    returnURL: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/google/return',
    realm: 'http://localhost:3000/'

      // To keep the example simple, the user's Google profile is returned to
      // represent the logged-in user.  In a typical application, you would want
      // to associate the Google account with a user record in your database,
      // and return that user instead.
      profile.identifier = identifier;
      return done(null, profile);

// Simple route middleware to ensure user is authenticated.
//   Use this route middleware on any resource that needs to be protected.  If
//   the request is authenticated (typically via a persistent login session),
//   the request will proceed.  Otherwise, the user will be redirected to the
//   login page.
